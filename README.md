# Smart Power Meter

## Project objective
Create a smart device to measure the energy consumption of a home or commercial establishment and provide real-time information about electricity consumption. With this, the user can monitor and control their energy consumption more efficiently, saving money on their electricity bill and reducing environmental impact.

## Advantages and innovation
- Real-time notifications about energy consumption, alerting the user when consumption is higher than expected or when there are consumption spikes.
- Personalized suggestions to reduce energy consumption, based on user usage patterns and consumption history.
- Graphs and reports to visualize energy consumption data over time. In addition, the project promotes sustainability, as it encourages energy savings.
